Implied emission factors for N2O, CH4 and CO2  as well activity data (consumption of gasolines in agriculture) are also provided.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This domain contains data on GHG emissions, associated emission factors and underlying activity data. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions database was produced by the FAO Monitoring and Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Potential in Agriculture project (MAGHG), with generous funding from the Governments of Norway and Germany, trust funds GCP/GLO/286/GER and GCP/GLO/325/NOR.\"\r\n"

The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 2, Ch. 2 and 3 with the exception of the country emission factors electricity-only (see below).\r\nData are estimated per main energy carrier (fuels and electricity) used in agriculture, for the following energy carriers: Motor gasoline; Gas-Diesel oil; Natural gas; Residual fuel oil; Liquefied petroleum gas; Coal and Electricity; and per selected agriculture sub-domains (i.e. irrigation, fisheries). Renewable energy for electricity contributes to the GHG emission calculation indirectly, via country emission factors, which depend on a country’s energy mix for electricity generation.\r\n\r\nThe emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nA = Activity data, representing the amount of fuel consumed in Kt (1,000 metric tons) yr-1, TJ (terajoule) yr-1 or ktoe (k tons of oil equivalent) yr-1 for fuels, and GWh yr-1 for electricity (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed as kg of gas emitted per terajoule (for fuels) or gram per kilowatt hour (for electricity) of energy used per year (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data relative to fuels are taken from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Energy Statistics database; data relative to fuels used in fisheries, specifically “Gas-Diesel oil used in fisheries” and “Residual fuel oil used in fisheries” are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database “World energy balances”; finally for energy used for power irrigation the irrigated area is taken from FAO AQUASTAT (*). The activity data (**) cover the following:\r\na. Gas-Diesel oil (incl. fisheries);\r\nb. Motor gasoline;\r\nc. Natural gas (incl. Liquefied Natural Gas);\r\nd. Liquefied petroleum gas;\r\ne. Residual fuel oil (incl. fisheries);\r\nf. Coal (Other bituminous coal or, if not available, Hard coal);\r\ng. Electricity;\r\nh. Gas-diesel oil used in fisheries;\r\ni. Residual fuel oil used in fisheries;\r\nj. Energy for power irrigation\r\n\r\n(*) The irrigated area considered is the sum of “Total area equipped for full control irrigation: sprinkler” and “Total area equipped for full control irrigation: localized” taken from the FAO AQUASTAT database. Annual values in FAOSTAT are estimated by repeating the last-available value reported in AQUASTAT within the associated time interval. Regional factors indicating the energy needed to irrigate one hectare of land (Stout, 1990) have been applied to estimate the energy consumed for irrigation. Specifically: Europe, Northern America, Oceania: 1,929 kWh/ha; Africa, Asia: 2,411 kWh/ha; Central America, South America, Caribbean: 2,170 kWh/ha.\r\n\r\n(**) For a., b., d., e. and f. the amount of energy from the mass of fuels was derived using the Net Calorific Values reported in IPCC 2006, Vol. 2, Ch. 1, Tab. 1.2; \r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those reported by energy carrier in IPCC 2006, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, Tab.2.5 and Ch.3, Tab 3.31. A summary table is shown below:\r\nEnergy carrier - Use - CO2 - CH4 - N2O - kg/TJ\r\nGas/Diesel oil - Mobile - 74,100 - 4.15 - 28.6\r\nMotor gasoline - Mobile - 69,300 - 80 - 2\r\nNatural gas liquids - Stationary - 64,200 - 10 - 0.6\r\nResidual fuel oil -Stationary - 77,400 - 10 - 0.6\r\nLiquefied petroleum gases - Stationary - 63,100 - 5 - 0.1\r\nCoal (Other Bituminous Coal) - Stationary - 94,600 - 300 - 1.5\r\n\r\nFor electricity, country emission factors for CO2, namely electricity-only factors, are those reported by IEA (OECD/IEA, 2012). They are based on 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 1990 country emission factors are applied to previous years. Non-CO2 emissions factors for electricity used for all countries are estimated on the basis the IEA global electricity emission factor for CO2, considering these emissions as a fraction of the CO2 emitted (CH4: 300/98300 for coal, 5/56100 for natural gas, 10/73300 for crude oil; N2O: 1.5/98300 for coal, 0.1/56100 for natural gas, 0.6/73300 for crude oil) and an energy mix for electricity as follows: 48% coal, 22% natural gas, 6% crude oil. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-6, to convert kg to Gg; and\r\nGWP-CH4= 21; GWP-N2O= 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 or Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq.
