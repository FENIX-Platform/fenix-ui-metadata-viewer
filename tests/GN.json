(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf).\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop residues consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen (N) in crop residues and forage/pasture renewal left on agricultural fields by farmers. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the deposition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2 and 11. \r\n\r\nDirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF     \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in units of kg N2O yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of N in crop residues in kg N yr-1, (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data are calculated from Crop yield and harvested area and cover for the following crop categories: Barley, Beans-dry, Maize, Millet, Oats, Potatoes, Rice-paddy, Rye, Sorghum, Soybeans, and Wheat. Crop yield and harvested area are used to estimate the amount of biomass N in above and below-ground residues by crop and by country, using IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Eq. 11.6 default crop values in Tab. 11.2. In a few cases where default parameters were not provided (N content of below-ground residues for Rice and Millet, and Ratio of below-ground residues to above-ground biomass for Millet, Sorghum, Rye, and Dry bean) the correspondent default values for crops with similar biophysical characteristics were used. This biomass N amount is then reduced by the fraction of crop residue burnt on site—assumed to be 10% by area, following IPCC, 2000: Ch. 4, Section 4A.2.1.1 —with specified combustion coefficients by crop, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.6. Finally, all N in crop residues, net of amount burnt, is assumed to remain on the field, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Eq. 11.6. \r\nFor the period 1961-present, Crop yield and harvested area are taken from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Crops). Projections of crop yield and harvested area for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n(2) Global default EF values taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nIndirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF where:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions, in units of Gg N2O yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the fraction of N in crop residues forage/pasture renewal that is lost through runoff and leaching in kg N yr-1 (3);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N / kg N yr-1 (4).\r\n\r\n(3) Obtained through the leaching factor in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11,Tab. 11.3.  \r\n\r\n(4) Global IPCC default EF values from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-3, to convert the activity data from kg to tonnes;\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg N2O to Gg N2O; and\r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.
