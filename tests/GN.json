Estimations are first produced within spatially distributed grids and then aggregated to national level. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions database was produced by the FAO Monitoring and Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Potential in Agriculture project (MAGHG), with generous funding from the Governments of Norway and Germany, trust funds GCP/GLO/286/GER and GCP/GLO/325/NOR.\"\r\n"

They consist of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and, only in the case of Organic Soils, also Carbon Dioxide (CO2). \r\nHumid Tropical Forest is defined by aggregation of the following FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones (FAO 2012): “Tropical rainforest” and ‘’Tropical moist deciduous forest”.\r\n\r\nOther Forest area contains the rest of the FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones for Forest.\r\n\r\nOrganic Soils are defined as the Histosols class in the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), consistently with the FAOSTAT Emissions database ‘’Cultivation Organic Soils’’ definitions. \r\n\r\nEmissions are estimated following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.27, by aggregation to the national level of spatially distributed information, produced on a spatial grid at 0.25 degree resolution (approximately 25 km at the equator). \r\n\r\nFor each item, and at each pixel, the following formula is used: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\n\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in g CH4 , g N2O and g CO2.\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total mass of fuel burned, in kg of dry matter (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1 IPCC emission factor, expressed in g CH4 , g N2O or g CO2 , per kg of burned dry matter (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Total mass of fuel burned is computed by multiplying burned area (i) by fuel biomass consumption values (ii).\r\n\r\n(i) Yearly composite values of burned area are obtained as the sum of monthly burned area data from the Global Fire Emission Database v.4 (GFED4; Giglio et al. 2013). For forest, the GFED4 burned forest area is an aggregate of burned area in the following MODIS land cover classes (MCD12Q1, Hansen et al., 2000): Evergreen Needle-leaf, Evergreen Broadleaf, Deciduous Needle-leaf, Deciduous Broadleaf, and Mixed Forest. \r\nFor ‘’Humid Tropical Forest,’’ burned area is obtained by overlapping GFED4 Burned Forest area data with the relevant FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones.\r\nFor ‘’Other Forest,’’ burned area is obtained as GFED4 burned Forest area minus Humid Tropical Forest burned area.\r\nFor “Organic Soils,’’ burned areas is obtained by overlapping GFED4 Burned area data with the Histosols class information of the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), assuming even distribution of organic soils within the grid cell. \r\n\r\n(ii) Fuel biomass consumption values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.4. The different values are climate dependent, and were geographically allocated using the JRC Climate Zones map (EC-JRC, 2010).\r\n\r\n(2) EF values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.5. The different values were assigned at pixel level to the relevant climate zone. The climatic zones map used has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010), following the IPCC prescriptions.\r\nFor each item, Emissions at pixel level were subsequently aggregated at country level, using the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4  and g N2O to Gg N2O;\r\nGWP- CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq.                 \r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nEC-JRC 2010.
